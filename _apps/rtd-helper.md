Get URL of documents when review changes in docs directory.

Work with Read The Docs, then you'll find that PR for documentation needs additional steps like:

* running RTD build for your branch manually, to use its result as staging site [like this](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/697#issue-201455071), or
* sharing screenshot to share the updated document [like this](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/718#issue-205904835).

This bot automates the first approach; activate RTD build automatically when you made PR that updates `docs/` directory.
